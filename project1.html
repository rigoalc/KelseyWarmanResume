      Looking for a challenging and rewarding opportunity that will leverage my experience abroad as well my creativity and passion for helping others.
      I am very detail-oriented,  my objective is to obtain a position where
      my organizational skills will be put to good use while allowing me the
      opportunity to grow within the company.
      Some of my favorites activities for the last 25 years are playing guitar and carpentry.
      Years ago I put music and computers together, two of my passions, setting up my home recording studio.
